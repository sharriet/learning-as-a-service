                            <p>Individuals and teams must take responsibility for their own learning in order to achieve true autonomy. Think of LaaS as an enabling team, seeking to increase the autonomy and learning efficacy of those it serves. Ideally it is short lived, offering a cost-saving alternative to a more traditional HR-led Learning & Development (L&D) function.</p>

                            <p>For digital transformation to work, it's the people as well the technology that need to evolve. Transforming people is a gradual process, and one that can't be administered via YouTube tutorials or an e-learning platform. It calls on leaders to build a culture in which people are supported to learn autonomously. LaaS can help you to do that.</p>

                            <p>In a recession, L&D will be the first thing many leaders think of cutting back on. What they may fail to understand is that learning is a habit. You cannot turn it off and on will. When you make learning cuts, your learning culture may suffer, and your people may lose their learning efficacy. This is bad news for innovation and resilience within a fast-changing sector.</p>
                            <p><em>However...</em> it is possible to continue to nurture a culture of continuous learning on a more modest budget.</p>
